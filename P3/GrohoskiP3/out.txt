One summer day,a littlebrown dog watched acat in a tree.  Can I get up there? Do Idare?  Is iteven worth a tryfor me?  Meowed the cat,give me a break! I came uphere to chase a bird, butit flew,just when I got near enough tokill it.  I wanna get down;let me out of here!meowrrrr!neow!oww!  Oh,pleasequit watching me.  Maybe I canrun fast enough ifspot looks the other way.  I'll slink down the back side ofthis tree and rununder theviburnum bush.  Iwish spot would make hisx-it.yeow! Here is my chance, Izoom, I fly!  It's now~ or die!
