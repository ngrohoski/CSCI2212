Chinggis Khan and his empire have a fearsome reputation in local histories. 
Many medieval chroniclers and modern historians describe Chinggis Khan's 
conquests as wholesale destruction on an unprecedented scale, causing 
great demographic changes and a drastic decline of population as a result 
of mass exterminations and famine. A conservative estimate amounts to 
about four million civilians (whereas other figures range from forty to 
sixty million) who lost their lives as a consequence of Chinggis Khan's 
military campaigns. In contrast, Buddhist Uyghurs of the kingdom of Qocho, 
who willingly left the Qara Khitai empire to become Mongol vassals, viewed 
him as a liberator. Chinggis Khan was also portrayed positively by early 
Renaissance sources out of respect for the great spread of culture, technology 
and ideas under the Mongol Empire. By the end of the Great Khan's life, 
the Mongol Empire occupied a substantial portion of Central Asia and China. 
Due to his exceptional military successes, Chinggis Khan is often considered 
to be one of the greatest conquerors of all time.
